# ToDo App

A simple ToDo application built using Kotlin, designed to demonstrate the implementation of the MVVM architecture along with several Android development best practices.

## Features

- **MVVM Architecture**: Utilizes the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern to separate concerns and improve testability.
- **Room Database**: Implements Room for local data storage, providing an abstraction layer over SQLite.
- **Navigation Component**: Uses the Android Jetpack Navigation Component for fragment navigation and argument passing.
- **Safe Args**: Ensures type-safe arguments when navigating between fragments.
- **LiveData**: Observes data changes and updates the UI accordingly.
- **Coroutines**: Manages background tasks and asynchronous programming using Kotlin Coroutines.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: The primary programming language used for Android development.
- **Room Database**: For local data storage and management.
- **Navigation Component**: For handling navigation within the app.
- **Safe Args**: For safe argument passing between fragments.
- **LiveData**: For observing data changes and updating the UI.
- **Coroutines**: For managing background tasks and asynchronous operations.
